**Better Sleep** helps you:
- see the best times to wake up if you go to sleep now
- find recommended bedtimes based on when you want to wake up
- use 90-minute sleep cycles (plus a small buffer for falling asleep)

Built with React + Vite, with a calm UI designed for nighttime use.

## How it works

Sleep is often estimated in ~90-minute cycles. Better Sleep suggests times that line up with those cycles to help avoid waking up in the middle of one.

This app also includes a small fallback buffer (~14 minutes) for the time it takes to fall asleep.

> This is a general estimate, not medical advice.
